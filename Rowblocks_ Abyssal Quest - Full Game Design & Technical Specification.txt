Rowblocks: Abyssal Quest - Full Game Design & Technical Specification
1. Game Concept & High-Level Vision
Rowblocks: Abyssal Quest is a stunning, third-person open-world aquatic adventure that combines the exploration and collection appeal of Pokémon Snap and Animal Crossing: New Horizons with the cooperative gameplay and physics of Journey and Deep Rock Galactic. Set in a vast, procedurally assisted ocean, players become "Rowlocks," curious and courageous aquatic beings, on a mission to restore vibrancy to the reefs, rescue marine life, and uncover the mysteries of the deep.
2. Core Gameplay Pillars
* Exploration & Discovery: A vast, beautiful, and sometimes dangerous ocean to explore, from sunlit coral plateaus to pitch-black hydrothermal vents.
* Collection & Progression: A "Marinepedia" to fill with hundreds of unique fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods, each with common, uncommon, rare, and legendary variants.
* Rescue & Restoration: Dynamic world events where players must work together to save marine life from human threats and environmental disasters.
* Cooperative Multiplayer: Seamless drop-in/drop-out multiplayer for up to 4 players to explore, solve puzzles, and complete rescues together.
* Customization & Home Base: A personal "Coral Cabin" and the player's Rowlock character can be customized with items found and earned in the world.
3. The World & Environments (Biomes)
The world is divided into several distinct, hand-crafted biomes that use procedural generation within their rules to make each visit feel slightly new.
* Sun-Kissed Shallows: Vibrant coral reefs, clear water, sunken shipwrecks (safe to explore). Home to common fish.
* The Kelp Forest: A towering, maze-like forest with swaying kelp. Players can get temporarily tangled. Home to otters and camouflaged fish.
* The Abyssal Plain: A vast, sandy expanse with eerie bioluminescent life, craters, and buried secrets.
* Hydrothermal Vent Fields: Volcanic, dangerous, and beautiful. Requires heat resistance. Home to extremophile life.
* The Blue Dystopia: A vast, open-water biome with a haunting beauty. Giant whales, manta rays, and the risk of predators.
* The Plastic Gyre (Hazard Biome): A polluted area filled with ghost nets, plastic bags, and sick creatures. A primary area for rescue missions.
* The Sunken City (End-Game): An ancient, mysterious city made of coral and stone, filled with advanced puzzles and the rarest legendary fish.
4. The Player Character: The Rowlock
* Appearance: A charming, anthropomorphic aquatic creature with smooth, gliding movement. Glowing markings that can be customized.
* Abilities:
   * Sonar Ping: The core ability. Sends out a pulse that highlights interactive objects, fish silhouettes, and other players.
   * Echo Call: A targeted call to attract the attention of nearby fish or players.
   * Nudge: A gentle force push to manipulate small objects, untangle a friend, or scare a fish.
   * Speed Burst: A short, fast dash to escape danger.
   * Bioluminescence: A toggleable light for dark areas, its color and intensity can be upgraded/customized.
5. The Marinepedia: Collection & Fish AI
* Total Fish: Over 300 unique species.
* Rarity Tiers:
   * Common (40%): Seen frequently in their home biome.
   * Uncommon (30%): Require specific conditions (time of day, following a current).
   * Rare (20%): Shy, require bait, or are only found during specific world events (e.g., a "Giant Squid" during a deep-sea brine waterfall).
   * Legendary (10%): Unique, named creatures with mini-quests to unlock. e.g., "Kael, the Leviathan of the Abyss."
* Fish AI: Fish have simple behaviors: Idle, Schooling, Flee, Curious (will investigate a player's light or a specific echo call). Rare fish are harder to approach and may require multiple players using echo calls in harmony to calm them.
6. Rescue Missions & Dynamic Events (Filling the Gaps!)
The ocean is alive with events that players can choose to engage with.
* Ghost Nets: A tangled, drifting net with trapped fish/players. Players must work together to "nudge" the breaking points (highlighted by sonar).
* Fishing Lines: A visible line with hook and bait. A player can get "hooked," causing them to be rapidly reeled towards the surface in a tense mini-game. Other players must dash into the line to break it.
* Sick/Cleaning Stations: Some fish (like Parrotfish or Manta Rays) will be covered in parasites. Players can "nudge" them clean for a reward.
* Ocean Acidification Events: Parts of a reef will become grey and lifeless. Players must find and guide specific "Algae-Eating" fish schools to the area to restore it.
* Predator/Prey Chases: A small fish might flee from a Barracuda. The player can intervene by distracting the predator.
* Litter Cleanup: Collecting floating plastic bags and bottles rewards "Conservation Points."
7. Multiplayer & Social Features
* Seamless Co-op: Players see "Echo Signals" of others in their world. They can join a player's instance simply by swimming towards them.
* Non-Verbal Communication: Inspired by Journey. Players can only communicate through chirps, sonar pings, and body language. This creates universal, friendly interaction.
* Shared Goals: Rescue missions and large puzzles scale in difficulty and require cooperation.
* "Coral Cabin" Neighborhoods: Players can choose to place their customizable home base in a shared "reef" with friends.
8. Progression & Economy
* Currency:
   * Pearls: Found in clams, rewarded for rescues. Used for cosmetic items.
   * Conservation Points: Earned from cleaning and restoration. Used to unlock new abilities and sonar modules.
* Progression:
   * Unlock new biomes by restoring the previous one.
   * Upgrade Sonar range, Nudge strength, and Bioluminescence.
   * Fill the Marinepedia to unlock titles and special legendary fish quests.

Technical Specification & AI-Assisted Development Guide
1. Recommended Game Engine: Unreal Engine 5
* Why UE5?
   * Nanite: For incredibly detailed coral and rock assets without performance cost.
   * Lumen: For stunning, dynamic global illumination and caustics (light patterns on the sea floor). This is critical for the underwater aesthetic.
   * Blueprints & C++: Perfect for rapid prototyping with Blueprints, then optimizing key systems with C++.
   * World Partition: Seamlessly streams the massive open world.
   * Multiplayer Framework: Robust, built-in tools for replication.
2. Core Technical Systems & AI Prompts
Here is how you can use AI (like ChatGPT, Claude, or specialized coding assistants) to help build this. Use these as direct prompts.
A. AI for Game Design Document Expansion:
"Act as a senior game designer. Expand on the 'Rescue Mission' for the 'Ghost Nets' in my underwater game. Detail a 3-phase encounter for 2-4 players, including the mechanics, player roles, fail states, and reward structure."
B. AI for Blueprint Scripting (UE5):
"I need an Unreal Engine 5 Blueprint script for a simple fish AI. The fish should have three states: 1) Idle/Wander, 2) Flee from the player if they get too close, and 3) Be attracted to a player actor if the player is emitting a specific 'Echo Call' interface event. Please provide the Blueprint logic and a basic C++ class structure for the Fish AI controller."
C. AI for 3D Model Generation & Concept Art:
"Generate a concept art mood board for a 'charming and courageous aquatic creature called a Rowlock' that lives in a vibrant coral reef. The style should be Pixar-esque, friendly, and have bioluminescent patterns." (Use tools like Midjourney, DALL-E 3)
"Create a low-poly 3D model of a 'Regal Tang' fish for my game, suitable for mobile VR. Provide the OBJ file and a simple, tiling texture map." (Use tools like Masterpiece Studio, Kaedim)
D. AI for Shader and VFX Code:
"Write an Unreal Engine 5 material function for a water shader that includes caustics projection onto the sea floor and a slight distortion effect for objects viewed through it. Use HLSL within the material graph."
E. AI for Sound Design:
"Generate a 2-minute ambient underwater soundscape for a deep kelp forest. It should include gentle water movement, distant whale calls, and the subtle cracks and pops of marine life. Layer in a subtle, mysterious melodic motif." (Use tools like Audo.ai, Soundraw)
3. Key Technical Components to Build
* Advanced Water System: Use UE5's Fluid Flux plugin or a custom solution for buoyancy, currents, and turbulence.
* Network Replication: Crucial for multiplayer. Must replicate fish positions, player states, dynamic event progress, and physics objects.
* Procedural Content Generation (PCG): Use UE5's new PCG tools to place coral, rocks, and vegetation in biomes to ensure variety.
* Modular Interaction System: A core "Interactable" interface that everything—fish, nets, items—inherits from.
* Save Game System: Must handle the massive Marinepedia data, player progression, and the state of the world's restoration.
4. Monetization & Live Service (To ensure people keep playing)
* Ethical Model: The game is a one-time purchase.
* Post-Launch "Expansion Packs": Paid DLC that adds entirely new biomes (e.g., "Arctic Depths," "Cenote Caves") with new fish, stories, and legendary creatures.
* Cosmetic Shop: For Pearls, selling new Rowlock skins, bioluminescence patterns, Coral Cabin furniture, and sonar ping effects. No pay-to-win.
